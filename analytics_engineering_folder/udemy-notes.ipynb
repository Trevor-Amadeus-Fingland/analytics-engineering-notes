    "Relational OLTPs(OnLine Transaction Processing) is used in transactional data. Examples include CRM or banking data. This kind of processing excels in running insert, update and/or delete operations. Data is stored as rows and must be available 24/7.Due to the always online nature of the systems that use OLTP they also have substantial disaster recovery and backup systems.<br><br>\n",
    "The OLTP source is the original source of data and typically acts as a source of truth.Queries tend to be simplistic and usually only act on a few records at a time. An example is applying an update to a single customer record after they updated their phone number. Data is highly normalized with minimal data redundancies. <br><br>\n",
    "In brief, normalization is the process by which relationships are created between tables. The result is that redundancies are reduced, removes inconsistent data dependencies and preserves data integrity. An example of this process would breaking out a single sales table into smaller sub-tables. One table would be a lookup for customer details, the other details items in each individual order, and the last being a high-level overview of orders places. These can then be connected back to each other with a customer id or order id depending on what tables need to be joined for analysis.<br><br>\n",

    "__NO-SQL__\n",
    "These are non-relational databases and are usually used in tandem with relational databases. No-SQL databases come in a few flavors.\n",
    "- Key-Value stores: these are mappings where a unique key is called to retrieve data from the database. These are useful when data retrieval speed is important. Queries and data tend to not be complex. These are used in things like shopping carts, user sessions or  product recommendations.\n",
    "- Document Stores: This database stores records and data as a single document. There is no need for schema creation and scales well horizontally via sharding. These documents are JSON-like. Multiple documents are referred to as collections. They are good for product catalogs, web apps and e-commerce.\n",
    "- Wide Column stores: Stores data in columns instead of rows. The difference from OLAP is that the format of the columnns doesn't need to be consistent between columns. These systems are highly scalable. Columns only need not exist in every row like in OLAP. However, this functionality limits usage of the store. It shouldn't be used for ad-hoc or highly aggregated data sets. Used for doing real time analytics and timeseries data.\n",
    "- Graph Database: A database structured around relationships between entities. Entities are stored as nnodes and relationships are stored as edges. Information associated with nodes are called properties. Being centered on relationships allows for quick query access as they do not need to be calculated at query execution. This also allows for complex querying that will be independent of the data size. These are used in ML tools like Recommenders or NLPs.They can also be used for fraud detection, social networks or logistics.\n",
    "- Search Engine Databases: These are databases that allow for data retrieval via search tool. This could be a web search or full text search. Data is stored in a JSON document with no schema. Example use cases include full-text searchs, time series data, and auto suggestion/auto completion."
