    "Databases can be broken into two major types, SQL and NO-SQL(means NOT Only sql).NO-SQL is capable of dealing with semi-structured(JSONs/mappings) or unstructured(open-ended comments on a forum) data. It can also access structured data as well.<br><br>\n",
    "Relational OLTPs(OnLine Transaction Processing) is used in transactional data. Examples include CRM or banking data. This kind of processing excels in running insert, update and/or delete operations. Data is stored as rows and must be available 24/7.Due to the always online nature of the systems that use OLTP they also have substantial disaster recovery and backup systems.<br><br>\n",
    "The OLTP source is the original source of data and typically acts as a source of truth.Queries tend to be simplistic and usually only act on a few records at a time. An example is applying an update to a single customer record after they updated their phone number. Data is highly normalized with minimal data redundancies. <br><br>\n",
    "In brief, normalization is the process by which relationships are created between tables. The result is that redundancies are reduced, removes inconsistent data dependencies and preserves data integrity. An example of this process would breaking out a single sales table into smaller sub-tables. One table would be a lookup for customer details, the other details items in each individual order, and the last being a high-level overview of orders places. These can then be connected back to each other with a customer id or order id depending on what tables need to be joined for analysis."
